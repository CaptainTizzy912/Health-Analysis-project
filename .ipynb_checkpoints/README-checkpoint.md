## Dataset
The dataset contains patient health metrics such as age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose levels, and lifestyle habits.

## Objectives
- Perform comprehensive EDA
- Visualize health risk patterns
- Build a regression model to predict heart disease

## Key Insights
- High BMI, cholesterol, and blood pressure increase heart disease risk
- Smoking significantly correlates with heart disease
- Physical activity reduces risk

## Model
A Logistic Regression model was trained to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
